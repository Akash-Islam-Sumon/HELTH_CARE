Our main goals is to make differences in the Bangladeshi healthcare industry. We would like to Bangladesh and it’s people to have a whole new view on how improvised health sector could be if we could just team up and create more rooms for development. We are currently working within Dhaka. Unfortunately, due to lack of resources we don’t have enough funds to cover the whole country. We are looking forward to cover not only Dhaka but Bangladesh. We don’t have any funds running on so all of our work is what break our blood, sweat and tears onto. We would be very glad if we could receive a little help with the resource and funding process.
